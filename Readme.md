To add the Blackbox Exporter installation and Prometheus configuration to the README with the replacement of "optit" for security, hereâ€™s a refined version that includes placeholders for secure variables:

---

## Blackbox Exporter Installation

### Overview:
Prometheus Blackbox Exporter is a tool to monitor external services like HTTP, DNS, TCP, and ICMP.

---

### Step 1: Installing Blackbox Exporter using Helm Chart

```bash
helm repo list -n monitoring
helm repo update -n monitoring
helm install prometheus-blackbox-exporter prometheus-community/prometheus-blackbox-exporter -n monitoring
```

---

### Step 2: Verifying Installation

After installation, you will see a new pod and service like the following:

- **Pod Name:** `prometheus-blackbox-exporter-<id>`
- **Service Name:** `prometheus-blackbox-exporter`

---

### Step 3: Update Prometheus Configuration

1. Use the custom `values.yml` file for Prometheus configurations.
2. **File Location:** `/path/to/your/config/`

Add the following lines in the `values.yml` file to scrape targets using Blackbox Exporter:

```yaml
# Add Blackbox Exporter scrape config
additionalScrapeConfigs:
  - job_name: "blackbox_exporter"
    metrics_path: /probe
    params:
      module: [http_2xx]
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - ${URL_1}
        - ${URL_2}
        - ${URL_3}
        - http://10.10.30.93:9208/
        - http://10.10.30.93:9205/
        - http://10.10.30.93:9695/
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: prometheus-blackbox-exporter:9115
```

- Replace `${URL_1}`, `${URL_2}`, and `${URL_3}` with the target URLs for monitoring.

---

### Step 4: Upgrade Prometheus Deployment

```bash
helm upgrade prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus -n monitoring -f values.yml
```

---

### Step 5: Grafana Dashboard

In Grafana, you can import a public dashboard using the **ID 7587** or create a custom dashboard to monitor the Blackbox Exporter metrics.

---

### Configuring Custom Alert Rules for Blackbox Exporter

#### Step 1: Create a Custom Alert Rule File

Save the alert rule configuration as `blackbox-exporter-rules.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: blackbox-exporter-rules
  labels:
    prometheus: kube-prometheus
    role: alert-rules1
spec:
  groups:
    - name: Blackbox_Exporter_rules
      rules:
        - alert: URLDown
          expr: probe_success == 0
          for: 1m
          labels:
            severity: critical
          annotations:
            summary: "A monitored URL is down"
            description: "A monitored URL of job has been down for more than 1 minute."
```

Apply the file:

```bash
kubectl apply -f blackbox-exporter-rules.yaml
```

---

#### Step 2: Update `values.yml` for Helm Chart

```yaml
prometheus:
  prometheusSpec:
    ruleSelector:
      matchExpressions:
        - key: role
          operator: In
          values: ["alert-rules1"]
```

---

### Step 6: Configuring Alertmanager

Add the following to `values.yml` for Alertmanager:

```yaml
alertmanager:
  enabled: true
  alertmanagerSpec:
    replicas: 1
    externalUrl: http://alertmanager-operated.monitoring.svc:9093
    config:
      global:
        smtp_smarthost: 'smtp.gmail.com:587'
        smtp_from: '${EMAIL_FROM}'
        smtp_auth_username: '${EMAIL_USERNAME}'
        smtp_auth_password: '${EMAIL_PASSWORD}'
        smtp_require_tls: true
      resolve_timeout: 5m
      route:
        group_by: ['job']
        group_wait: 30s
        group_interval: 5m
        repeat_interval: 5m
        receiver: 'email'
        routes:
          - matchers:
              - job = blackbox_exporter
            receiver: 'email'
      receivers:
        - name: 'email'
          email_configs:
            - to: '${RECIPIENT_EMAIL}'
              require_tls: true
              send_resolved: false
      templates:
        - '/etc/alertmanager/config/*.tmpl'
```

---

### Step 7: Upgrade the Helm Chart with Alertmanager

```bash
helm upgrade prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -f values.yml --namespace monitoring
```

---

### Future Next Steps:
- Ensure you replace all `${VARIABLES}` with your specific values for security.
- Add additional custom monitoring targets as needed.
- Update alert rules or configurations as your monitoring needs evolve.

Would you like me to add any specific future steps or further customization?
